# C-Examples
These are the C++ code examples I created for my C++ programming class. There are 14 weeks of projects. Each project is located in its respective week's folder.

- wk1 : Week 1 is a simple Hello World program.
- wk2 : Week 2 is a program that sums all the digits of a user given integer.
- wk3 : Week 3 is a program that takes two user input values and prints the sum, difference, product, quotient, and modulus.
- wk4 : Week 4 is a guessing game where a random number between 1-100 is chosen and the user must correctly guess the number, hints are given along the way.
- wk5 : Week 5 simulates the game Nim where there are 22 sticks in a pile and the player takes turns against the computer, the one to pick up the last stick wins.
- wk6 : Week 6 is a program that outputs the distance in meters that an object falls over 10 seconds.
- wk7 : Week 7 is a program that takes a user given temperature and converts it either to Fahrenheit or Celsius depending on the user's input.
- wk8 : Week 8 is a program that takes a user-defined amount of marbles and digitally simulates a Galton board.
- wk9 : Week 9 is a program that takes a randomly sorted array and sorts it using the bubble sort method.
- wk10 : Week 10 is a program that simulates a simple game of Craps.
- wk11 : Week 11 is a set of files that implements a Point class.
- wk 12 : Week 12 includes the below files.
  - FindMax.cpp : Creates an array of 10 numbers then prints the largest value and its address.
  - Functions1.cpp : Takes two numbers and returns sum and quotient.
  - Functions2.cpp : Takes three numbers and sorts them in ascending order.
  - Grades.cpp : Returns the letter grade of 10 randomly generated number grades.
- wk13 : Week 13 is a set of files that implements a Shape and Triangle class along with implementation files.
- wk14: Week 14 Demonstrates polymorphism using a base class and three derived classes and an implementation section.
